## 📅 July 3, 2025

### ✅ Initial Setup
- Created clean architecture structure with four layers:
  - **Domain**: added `Project` entity with name and description
  - **Application**: planned `ProjectService`, `ProjectDto`, and interfaces
  - **Infrastructure**: set up `DbContext` and started designing repository pattern
  - **Endpoint**: pending controller setup

### 🌐 Git Repository Setup
- Initialized local Git project with `git init`
- Added files and committed with `git add .` and `git commit`
- Created repository on GitHub manually due to 404 error
- Fixed malformed remote URL: corrected `https:github.com/...` to `https://github.com/...`
- Generated a Personal Access Token (PAT) for HTTPS authentication
- Successfully pushed project to GitHub: [`PortfolioApi`](https://github.com/maryamLashgari/PortfolioApi)

### 🤓 How to Keep It Updated

Every time you work on the project:
- Add a new heading like `## 📅 July 4, 2025`
- Note what you built, debugged, or designed
- Mention any new commands you used
- Track architecture decisions and TODOs

Would you like me to help you write your `README.md` next so your GitHub visitors instantly see what PortfolioApi is all about? That’s the cherry on top 🍒📘
